New preprint! [MAgICoRe: Multi-Agent, Iterative, Coarse-to-Fine Refinement for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147) led by [Justin Chih-Yao Chen]() with [Swarnadeep Saha](https://swarnahub.github.io), [Archiki Prasad](https://archiki.github.io), and [Mohit Bansal](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/) introduces a novel method for refinement that improves math reasoning by selectively refining only hard instances and by treating it as an iterative, multi-agent problem.
