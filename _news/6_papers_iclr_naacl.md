Six new papers accepted, three to ICLR and three to NAACL! [DataEnvGym](https://dataenvgym.github.io) (ICLR) introduces a new framework for developing agents that adaptively generate data for training student models. [System 1.x](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14414) (ICLR): planning with LLMs that balances quick action prediction with slower/more deliberate planning through verbalizing search traces.
[See It from My Perspective](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Xbl6t6zxZs) (ICLR) quantifies the effect of language on cultural bias in large vision-language models. 
[Persuasion-Balanced Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14596) (NAACL): multi-agent training method teaching models to balance accepting good persuasion while resisting misinformation/bad persuasion. [AdaCAD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07394) (NAACL): an adaptive method for balancing retrieved/context knowledge with a model's parametric knowledge. [MAMM-Refine](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HSkKSjSRCe#discussion) (NAACL) improves generation through multi-agent multi-model discussion, focusing on refinement.
