New work led by [Justin Chen](https://dinobby.github.io) and [Swarnadeep Saha](https://swarnahub.github.io) on distilling multi-agent LLM interactions into smaller models. MAGDi uses a graph structure on top of LLM dialogues to distill reasoning from several large teacher models into a single, lightweight student.
