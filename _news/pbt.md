New paper out! [Teaching Models to Balance Resisting and Accepting Persuasion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14596), where we use multi-agent recursive dialogue trees to teach models to accept and resist persuasion *when appropriate*. Our method reduces susceptibility to misinformation and flipflopping while also improving LLMs' ability to act together in a team thru multi-agent dialogue!
