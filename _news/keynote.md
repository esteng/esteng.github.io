Excited to be giving a keynote at the [UncertaiNLP workshop](https://uncertainlp.github.io) at EACL 2024, titled Confidence-based Rephrasing, Refinement, and Selection. I'll cover a wide range of topics including [calibration in semantic parsing](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00598/117737), [using calibrated models to improve usability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16857), [underspecified visual question answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05861) and much more!
