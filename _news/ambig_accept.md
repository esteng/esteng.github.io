Two papers accepted to ICLR 2024. [Zero and Few-shot Semantic Parsing with Ambiguous Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00824) introduces a new benchmark for semantic parsing with ambiguity and tests a variety of models on how they handle five common linguistic ambiguities. [Rephrase, Augment, Reason: Visual Grounding of Questions for Vision-Language Models
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05861) is the first paper from my new postdoc position and introduces RepARe, a method for augmenting and rephrasing VQA questions (especially underspecified ones) to make them easier for zero-shot VL models to answer.
