New preprint! [ReGAL: Refactoring Programs to Discover Generalizable Abstractions
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16467) introduces a new refactoring-based method for learning abstractions for LLM program prediction, improving performance on a variety of tasks. Joint work with [Archiki Prasad](https://archiki.github.io) as part of my postdoc at UNC.
