New preprint! [Learning to Generate Unit Tests for Automated Debugging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01619) with [Archiki Prasad](https://archiki.github.io), [Justin Chih-Yao Chen](https://dinobby.github.io), [Zaid Khan](https://zaidkhan.me), and [Mohit Bansal](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal) on how to improve automated debugging with generated unit tests. We train unit test generators, leveraging test-time scaling and validation across tests to improve debugging!
