New preprint! [DataEnvGym: Data Generation Agents in Teacher Environments with Student Feedback](https://dataenvgym.github.io) led by [Zaid Khan](https://zaidkhan.me) with [Jaemin Cho](https://j-min.io) and [Mohit Bansal](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal) on a novel testbed for creating data generation agents. These agents produce synthetic data for teaching student models based on their errors and weaknesses!
