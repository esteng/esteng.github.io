Three papers accepted to ICML 2024! [ReGAL: Refactoring Programs to Discover Generalizable Abstractions
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16467), which uses refactoring to discover program abstractions for LLM-based code generation, [MAGDi: Structured Distillation of Multi-Agent Interaction Graphs Improves Reasoning in Smaller Language Models
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01620), which introduces a structured distillation method for learning from discussions between multiple LLMs, and [Language-guided Skill Learning with Temporal Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16354), which learns reusable skills from trajectories of demonstrations.
