If you are a student looking to get in touch, please read the following:

**Questions about PhD admissions**: Unfortunately I cannot reply to every email. If you feel drawn to the topics/publications listed on my webpage, please mention me in your graduate application and I will read it. I am no longer taking applications for Fall 2026.

**Questions about internships**: I am open to recruiting interns; Please get in touch if you have specific questions or research ideas to discuss -- I will reach out to schedule video interviews if there is a good match to my current interests/bandwidth. 

**Questions about courses**: Please use the course page/canvas where possible. If you must email me, please include the course number in the subject line.
