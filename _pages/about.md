I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University, supervised by [Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/). In August 2023, I will be starting as a Postdoctoral Research Associate with [Mohit Bansal](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/) at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

In my work, supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, I aim to develop AI agents that can intelligently communicate and collaborate with people. 
A central focus of this involves communication via language: one line of my work focuses on transforming text into representations of its meaning and exploring how models represent meaning.
This has included work on semantic parsing, multimodal grounding, and human-robot interaction. 

Another line of work looks at implicit phenomena such as vagueness, underspecification, and ambiguity. 
While I've mostly explored these topics through a linguistic lens, I am interested in their importance to intelligence more broadly.

Before starting my Ph.D., I received my B.A.&Sc. with First Class Honours in Cognitive Science from McGill University, focusing in computer science and linguistics.
While at McGill, I worked as a research assistant at the Montreal Language Modeling Lab (MLML), now [MCQLL](https://mcqll.org) supervised by [Morgan Sonderegger](http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~morgan/).
I wrote my honours thesis (supervised by [Timothy O'Donnell](https://todonnell.github.io)) on a variational inference algorithm for a model of language acquisition.
