I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill in the [MURGe-Lab](https://murgelab.cs.unc.edu) led by [Mohit Bansal](https://murgelab.cs.unc.edu). 
I received my Ph.D. in 2023 from Johns Hopkins University, where I was supervised by [Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/) and supported by an NSF GRFP. 

I aim to develop AI agents that can intelligently communicate and collaborate with people and each other. 
A central focus of this involves communication via language: one line of my work focuses on transforming text into representations of its meaning and exploring how models represent meaning.
This has included work on semantic parsing, multimodal grounding, and human-robot interaction. 

Another line of work looks at implicit phenomena such as vagueness, underspecification, and ambiguity. 
While I've mostly explored these topics through a linguistic lens, I am interested in their importance to intelligence more broadly.

Some of the areas I've been working on recent are:


- **Confidence Estimation/Calibration**: 
    - [on pragmatic reasoning for better QA calibration (Stengel-Eskin et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21028)
    - [on calibration in semantic parsing (Stengel-Eskin and Van Durme, TACL 2023)](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00598/117737)
    - [on balancing safety and usability using confidence (Stengel-Eskin and Van Durme, EMNLP 2023)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.159/)

- **Learning skills/abstractions for agents and coding**: 
    - [on learning coding abstractions with LLMs (Stengel-Eskin et al., ICML 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16467)
    - [on discovering skills for RL agents (Fu et al., ICML 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16354)

    - [on a more effective/efficient self-consistency method for LLM agents (Wang et al., ACL 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13212)

- **Multi-agent reasoning**: 
    - [on structured distillion for learning from multiple LLM reasoning agents (Chen et al., ICML 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01620)
    - [on a new benchmark to assess game-theoretic abilities for LLM agents (Duan et al. 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12348)

Before starting my Ph.D., I received my B.A.&Sc. with First Class Honours in Cognitive Science from McGill University, focusing in computer science and linguistics.
While at McGill, I worked as a research assistant at the Montreal Language Modeling Lab (MLML), now [MCQLL](https://mcqll.org) supervised by [Morgan Sonderegger](http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~morgan/).
I wrote my honours thesis (supervised by [Timothy O'Donnell](https://todonnell.github.io)) on a variational inference algorithm for a model of language acquisition.
