  abstract = "Children acquiring English make systematic errors on subject control sentences even after they have reached near-adult competence (C. Chomsky, 1969), possibly due to heuristics based on semantic roles (Maratsos, 1974). Given the advanced fluency of large generative language models, we ask whether model outputs are consistent with these heuristics, and to what degree different models are consistent with each other. We find that models can be categorized by behavior into three separate groups, with broad differences between the groups. The outputs of models in the largest group are consistent with positional heuristics that succeed on subject control but fail on object control. This result is surprising, given that object control is orders of magnitude more frequent in the text data used to train such models. We examine to what degree the models are sensitive to prompting with agent-patient information, finding that raising the salience of agent and patient relations results in significant changes in the outputs of most models. Based on this observation, we leverage an existing dataset of semantic proto-role annotations (White, et al. 2020) to explore the connections between control and labeling event participants with properties typically associated with agents and patients.",

This requires additional training data and results in ever-growing datasets. We present the first systematic investigation into this incremental symbol learning scenario. Our analyses reveal a troubling quirk in building (broad-coverage) NLU systems: as the training dataset grows, more data is needed to learn new symbols, forming a vicious cycle. We show that this trend holds for multiple mainstream models on two common NLU tasks: intent recognition and semantic parsing. Rejecting class imbalance as the sole culprit, we reveal that the trend is closely associated with an effect we call source signal dilution, where strong lexical cues for the new symbol become diluted as the training dataset grows. Selectively dropping training examples to prevent dilution often reverses the trend, showing the over-reliance of mainstream neural NLU models on simple lexical cues and their lack of contextual understanding.",

In this paper, we investigate to what degree unimodal (language-only) and multimodal (image and language) models capture a broad range of visually salient attributes. To that end, we create the Visual Commonsense Tests (ViComTe) dataset covering 5 property types (color, shape, material, size, and visual co-occurrence) for over 5000 subjects. We validate this dataset by showing that our grounded color data correlates much better than ungrounded text-only data with crowdsourced color judgments provided by Paik et al. (2021). We then use our dataset to evaluate pretrained unimodal models and multimodal models. Our results indicate that multimodal models better reconstruct attribute distributions, but are still subject to reporting bias. Moreover, increasing model size does not enhance performance, suggesting that the key to visual commonsense lies in the data.",

Towards this goal, we propose a novel Transformer-based model which enables a user to guide a robot arm through a 3D multi-step manipulation task with natural language commands. Our system maps images and commands to masks over grasp or place locations, grounding the language directly in perceptual space. In a suite of block rearrangement tasks, we show that these masks can be combined with an existing manipulation framework without re-training, greatly improving learning efficiency. Our masking model is several orders of magnitude more sample efficient than typical Transformer models, operating with hundreds, not millions, of examples. Our modular design allows us to leverage supervised and reinforcement learning, providing an easy interface for experimentation with different architectures. Our model completes block manipulation tasks with synthetic commands 530% more often than a UNet-based baseline, and learns to localize actions correctly while creating a mapping of symbols to perceptual input that supports compositional reasoning. We provide a valuable resource for 3D manipulation instruction following research by porting an existing 3D block dataset with crowdsourced language to a simulated environment. Our method’s 25.3% absolute improvement in identifying the correct block on the ported dataset demonstrates its ability to handle syntactic and lexical variation.",

In this paper, we identify that the long-tail distribution of visual concepts and unequal importance of reasoning steps in real data are the two key obstacles that limit the models’ real-world potentials. To address these challenges, we propose a new paradigm, Calibrating Concepts and Operations (CCO), which enables neural symbolic models to capture underlying data characteristics and to reason with hierarchical importance. Specifically, we introduce an executor with learnable concept embedding magnitudes for handling distribution imbalance, and an operation calibrator for highlighting important operations and suppressing redundant ones. Our experiments show CCO substantially boosts the performance of neural symbolic methods on real images. By evaluating models on the real world dataset GQA, CCO helps the neural symbolic method NSCL outperforms its vanilla counterpart by a large margin of 9.1% (from 47.0% to 56.1%), which also greatly reduces the performance gap between symbolic and non-symbolic methods. Additionally, we create a perturbed test set for better understanding and analyzing model performance on real images.",

  abstract="Speech datasets from many languages, styles, and sources exist in the world, representing significant potential for scientific studies of speech—particularly given structural similarities among all speech datasets. However, studies using multiple speech corpora remain difficult in practice, due to corpus size, complexity, and differing formats. We introduce open-source software for unified corpus analysis: integrating speech corpora and querying across them. Corpora are stored in a custom ‘polyglot persistence’scheme that combines three sub-databases mirroring different data types: a Neo4j graph database to represent temporal annotation graph structure, and SQL and InfluxDB databases to represent meta-and acoustic data. This scheme abstracts away from the idiosyncratic formats of different speech corpora, while mirroring the structure of different data types improves speed and scalability. A Python API and a GUI both allow for: enriching the database with positional, hierarchical, temporal, and signal measures (eg utterance boundaries, f0) that are useful for linguistic analysis; querying the database using a simple query language; and exporting query results to standard formats for further analysis. We describe the software, summarize two case studies using it to examine effects on pitch and duration across languages, and outline planned future development.",
